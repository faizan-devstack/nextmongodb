# Dynamic User ID Retrieval App

This application demonstrates how to dynamically retrieve the user ID in a Next.js application using MongoDB, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The app is structured to handle dynamic routes and fetch user-specific data based on the user ID. Additionally, it includes features for password recovery and secure authentication.

## Features

- **Dynamic Route Handling**: Uses Next.js's dynamic routing feature (`[id]/page.tsx`) to fetch user data based on the user ID passed in the URL.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Fetches and interacts with user data stored in MongoDB, offering seamless CRUD operations.
- **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Provides a clean, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS for efficient design implementation.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better code quality with TypeScript integration.
- **Forgot Password**: Allows users to reset their password via email verification.
- **Reset Password**: Implements a secure process to reset a userâ€™s password after email verification.
- **Show/Hide Password**: Enables users to toggle visibility of their password in the input field for ease of use.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: For storing and retrieving user data.
- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and routing.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript to provide better tooling and code reliability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs.
